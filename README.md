HIGHLIGHT FEATURE #1:




Production Readme
To complete your full stack project you will have to create a production readme. The purpose of the readme is to show off your technical skills and guide someone who is visiting your repo for the first time. Think of it like a resume or cover letter - the production readme is an introduction to you as a skilled developer! There's a lot of great code hidden in your repo (and potentially some code you're okay with an employer not seeing), so use the readme to show off the places you excel.

Features of a great production readme:
Delve deep into ~2 features that show off your technical abilities. Discuss both the challenges faced and your brilliant solutions.
Code snippets to highlight your best code (markdown code snippets, NOT screenshots)
Pitfalls to avoid:
Do not list out every single feature on your app.
No screenshots; only screen clippings. i.e. Don't show your entire browser window and several other open tabs.
Don't refer to your app as your 'App Academy Full-Stack Project'. Present it as a professional site.
Don't wax on about the features that you didn't have time to implement. Simply list them at the bottom of the readme as future directions for the project.
Markdown rendering errors
Make sure to allot at least 3 hours to write your readme.
